  <a href=https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/Spring2022/tree/master/04-14_Srebro> What do we mean by 'non-discriminatory' in statistical prediction tasks? </a>

**Summary:**  Statistical prediction is inherently a discrimination task--discriminating between cases we predict will be in one target class versus the other.  Yet we frequently do not want to employ certain kinds of discrimination based on persectibed "protected attributes".  What kinds of discrimination do we not want?  I will argue this is very task and context specific, and we will try to explore whether we can translate different notions to operational statistical definitions.
