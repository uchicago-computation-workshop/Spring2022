**Summary:** Recent literature in fair machine learning (fair ML) has focused on applying notions of fairness within a technical scope involving data, models, and prediction quality across protected groups. This talk will start by presenting two technical solutions within this framework to overcome practical challenges, including (i) enforcing group-based fairness constraints when the data is incomplete or noisy, and (ii) avoiding unfair penalization of other input features. Still, beyond these practical challenges, even the most heavily fairness-constrained ML model might fall short in satisfying societal needs due to choices in problem formulation and downstream interventions. Thus, based on qualitative work in the education domain, we expand the scope of the ML life cycle and suggest opportunities beyond the typical fairness paradigms for technical and interdisciplinary contribution.

**Serena Wang** is a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley, advised by Prof. Rediet Abebe and Prof. Michael I. Jordan. Serena's research interests include understanding and improving the long term societal impacts of machine learning by rethinking ML algorithms and practices. On the algorithmic side, Serena employs tools from robust optimization, constrained optimization, and statistical learning theory. Serena has also concurrently held a 20% collaboration with Google Research where Serena has worked on improving ML interpretability and controllability. Serena is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
