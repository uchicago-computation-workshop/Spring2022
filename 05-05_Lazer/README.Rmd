**Summary:** What happened when Twitter deplatformed 70,000 right-wing extremists following the January 6 insurrection? Using a panel of over a half million active Twitter users and a sharp regression discontinuity design, we test the causal effects of this intervention on the circulation of misinformation by those deplatformed, and by users from adjacent groups such as misinformation supersharers, QAnon traffickers and deplatformed usersâ€™ followers. We show that Twitter's intervention reduced misinformation on the site substantially by preventing the deplatformed users from spreading it. We also show that similar, non-deplatformed users exited the platform in response to the intervention. The results inform the historical record of the insurrection, a momentous event in U.S. history, and show the capacity of social media platforms to control public discourse.

**David Lazerr** is a University Distinguished Professor of Political Science and Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, and Co-Director, NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks. Prior to coming to Northeastern University, he was on the faculty at the Harvard Kennedy School (1998-2009). In 2019, he was elected a fellow to the National Academy of Public Administration. His research has been published in such journals as Science, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, the American Political Science Review, Organization Science, and the Administrative Science Quarterly, and has received extensive coverage in the media, including the New York Times, NPR, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and CBS Evening News.

He is among the leading scholars in the world on misinformation and computational social science and has served in multiple leadership and editorial positions, including as a board member for the International Network of Social Network Analysts (INSNA), reviewing editor for Science, associate editor of Social Networks and Network Science, numerous other editorial boards and program committees.
