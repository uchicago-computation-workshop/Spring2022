**Summary:** Many people believe that to obtain the best possible forecast of an outcome such as the future inflation rate or a patient’s life expectancy, one should seek out the opinion of a trusted expert.  However, decades of research on “the wisdom of crowds” has demonstrated that this is false in two distinct ways. First, it is usually better to combine opinions in some way (e.g., averaging opinions, majority rule) than to rely on the opinion of a single individual. Second, remarkably, a combined opinion from a group of modestly informed individuals can often be as or more accurate than a chosen “expert”. Notably, although crowds can be wise, sometimes they are not. In this talk, I will discuss the ingredients needed for crowd wisdom. I will also discuss recent research that seeks to enhance the basic wisdom of crowds effect above and beyond what can be achieved by simple (yet surprisingly effective) methods such as averaging opinions.

**Jack Soll** is a professor of management and organizations at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, having joined Duke in 2005. He holds a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of Business, where he specialized in behavioral science and economics. Prior to joining Duke, Soll was on the faculty at INSEAD in Fontainebleau France, and also served as a visiting professor at Chicago and Wharton. Professor Soll has taught courses in decision making, managerial effectiveness, leadership, negotiations, and statistics. He has taught extensively in both executive education and daytime MBA programs. 

Professor Soll’s research focuses on the psychology of judgment and decision making. He has written extensively on the phenemenon of overconfidence—the tendency for people to believe that outcomes are more certain than they really are. His current research interests include group decision making, and also the implications of behavioral decision research for public policy. He has published in a number of scholarly journals, including Science, Management Science, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, and the Journal of Experimental Psychology.
